# Getting Data In

Need to get data into index. Done by admin. Good idea to understand how ingest works. Upload lets us upload files directly. Only indexed once. Monitor lets us monitor files, directories, HTTP events, network ports, and scripts. Can also monitor windows specific data. Forward lets us recieve data from external forwarders. 

Splunk uses source types to categorize data. Used in many search management functions. Indexes make searches more efficient and sorted. Only returns data from that index. Allows us to control who sees what data. Can retain data for different time intervals. 

Monitor when data's coming from files or ports on an indexer. 

Forwarders are out of the scope. Will be uploading in lab.
